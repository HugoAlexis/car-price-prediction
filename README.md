# car-price-prediction
Data science project for car price prediction using machine learning algorithms and exploratory data analysis.

## 1. Familiarize and prepare the data
The project commences with a segment dedicated to understanding and familiarizing ourselves with the data. In this phase, we import the data into a pandas DataFrame, rename its column names, and verify and rectify the data types. Additionally, we explore the data, identifying null values and outliers. Subsequently, we partition the data into training and test sets, allowing us to conduct exploratory data analysis exclusively on the test set.
